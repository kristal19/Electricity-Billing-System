# Electricity-Billing-System

The manual electricity billing system that is now in place takes a lot of time, is prone to mistakes, and lacks transparency. The current system requires human metre reading entry, usage calculations, and bill production. It is challenging to keep correct records and keep track of unpaid invoices. Additionally, there are few methods for clients to pay their bills, which can cause delays and hassles. An automated electricity billing system must be created in order to resolve these problems. Users will be able to enter their metre readings into the planned system, and invoices would be generated automatically depending on consumption. Additionally, the system will keep track of payments and provide notifications when payments are overdue. To ensure convenient and prompt payments, the system will also offer a variety of payment methods, including online payment
The objective of the project is to develop a robust and user-friendly electricity billing system using Java programming language that automates the billing process, reduces errors, improves transparency, and provides a hassle-free experience to both the utility company and the customers.
